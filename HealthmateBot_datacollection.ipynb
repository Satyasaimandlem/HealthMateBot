        "We aimed to create a database for our Healthmate bot within the sensitive healthcare domain, where data provided to the user must be accurate and trustworthy. However, sourcing open-source data posed a challenge due to its sensitive nature. Our bot's primary objective was to provide related diagnoses based on user-provided symptoms, yet acquiring a complete dataset of symptoms and associated conditions proved elusive. Consequently, we shifted focus to offering summaries and relevant physician specialties, along with nearby hospitals specializing in those areas, leveraging available resources. The latest XML data was imported from https://medlineplus.gov/xml.html, and the code below demonstrates the conversion of the XML file into a CSV format."
